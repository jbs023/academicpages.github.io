I am a Robotics PhD student at Oregon State University, where I work under Dr. Julie A. Adams in the [Human Machine Teaming Lab (HMTLab)](http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/hmtl/). My research interests lie at the intersection of human-robot interaction, machine learning, and multi-robot systems.
