I am a Robotics PhD student at Oregon State University, where I work under Julie Adams in the the [Human Machine Teaming Lab (HMTL)](http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/hmtl/). My research interests are human robot interaction and distributed artificial intelligence. 

Currently, I am focused on investigating techniques for modelling honeybee behaviors in large unmanned systems.
